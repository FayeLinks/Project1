# Project1: Bar Advisor

Bar Advisor targets the 21 and up crowd, allowing you to find local bars in your area. 

By allowing the app to use your location, it picks up bars that are near you showing the bar name, locations, price levels, and ratings. Bar go-ers are able to find bars that are within their budget and are conveniently in their area.

Using the Google API to grab the map and make it more convenient to find what's in your area.

There is also a Designated Driver link that takes you straight to the Uber website to book your ride.
